Fue publicado por Valve Corporation en formato digital y por Electronic Arts en formato físico. \r\n\r\nSu argumento sigue directamente al del primer juego, teniendo lugar en el universo Half-Life. El jugador encarna a Chell, un sujeto de pruebas en un centro de investigación dirigido anteriormente por la empresa Aperture Science, pero tomado por una IA maligna que se volvió contra sus creadores, GladOS. Tras derrotar a GladOS al final del primer juego, pero sin conseguir escapar de las instalaciones, Chell es despertada de una cámara de éxtasis por un núcleo de personalidad de IA, Wheatley, mientras el descuidado complejo se desmorona. Mientras los dos intentan navegar por las ruinas y escapar, tropiezan con GladOS, y accidentalmente la reactivan...\r\n\r\nLa mecánica central de Portal 2 es muy similar a la del primer juego; el jugador debe abrirse paso a través de varias cámaras de pruebas que implican rompecabezas. Para ello, posee una Pistola de Portales, un arma capaz de crear portales de teletransporte en superficies blancas. Esta mecánica aparentemente sencilla y sus sutilezas, unidas a los numerosos elementos de puzle que pueden aparecer en los rompecabezas, permiten que el juego sea fácil de empezar a jugar y, aun así, ofrezca una jugabilidad profunda. La secuela añade varios elementos de puzle nuevos, como el gel que puede hacer que las superficies reboten o que te permita acelerar al correr sobre ellas.\r\n\r\nEl juego suele ser elogiado por su jugabilidad, sus memorables diálogos y guiones y su estética. Los dos juegos de la serie son responsables de inspirar la mayoría de los juegos de puzzle que les sucedieron, en particular los juegos de puzzle en primera persona. La serie, sus personajes e incluso sus objetos, como la pistola de portales y el cubo de compañía, se han convertido en un icono cultural dentro de las comunidades de jugadores.\r\n\r\nPortal 2 también incluye un modo cooperativo en el que dos jugadores asumen el papel de robots dirigidos por GladOS, así como un editor de niveles en profundidad.'),

Durante la ronda del modo de enfrentamiento clásico, irás recibiendo divisas para comprar distintos equipos.

Pero el naufragio pospone el éxito de la llegada y la isla aparentemente olvidada está densamente poblada de habitantes hostiles, cultistas de la Hermandad Solarii.\r\nEl juego será gráfico en ocasiones, especialmente tras fallar los QTE durante algunas de las escenas de supervivencia, pero en general los jugadores disfrutarán de una aventura de acción clásica, que recuerda a los inicios de la serie. Este juego no es una secuela directa ni la continuación de una subserie ya existente dentro de la franquicia, sino un reinicio, en el que Tomb Raider representa la experiencia de juego moderna.\r\n\r\nEl juego tiene elementos de RPG y cuenta con un mundo, que puedes explorar durante la campaña de la historia y después de completarla. También cuenta con un modo multijugador, en el que 2 equipos (4 carroñeros y 4 supervivientes) se enfrentan en 3 modos de juego mientras utilizan armas y entornos de la campaña para un jugador.'),

And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. \r\nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics.

It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress\' bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player\'s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.'),

She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover\'s soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. \r\n\r\nWhen not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to \"focus\" and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.'),

Players can avoid direct confrontation by disguising themselves in other people’s uniforms and use environmental interactions to distract or kill unsuspecting targets. And in case of raising the alarm, players can try to rush the mission with the direct attack, using dozens of available weapons.\r\nPlayers can use special vision mechanic, called Instinct.

Meat Boy has only one life and cannot take any damage, but there is no limit on attempts, so players can try and fail the stage until they get it right or collect special bandages. Unique replay system will show the player every try they made at the same time right after they completed the level.\nSuper Meat boy has multiple characters, some of them are a different skin for Meat Boy and in-game adaptations of other indie-game protagonists, that can be unlocked by completing their special challenge levels, hidden somewhere in the campaign; or by collecting set amount of bandages. Players will be able to choose any unlocked character for any level from the main menu.

The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.\r\n\r\nThe main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nThe worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.');
